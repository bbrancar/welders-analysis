**Welding Fumes and Gene Expression**
---

Exposure to ambient particulate air pollution is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Godleski et al. 2000). The welding process creates high levels of metal fume containing respirable particles, associated with inflammatory lung disease such asthma, and cardiovascular events. This project assesses systemic alterations (e.g. changes in gene expression) from air pollution, caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines subsequent to pulmonary inflammation (precursors of atherosclerosis and coronary diseases). 

Experimental data contains pre- and post-exposure microarray readings for over 5000 genes for 18 exposed welders and 10 unexposed controls.

**Methods**

To determine whether exposure led to systemic alterations, we performed a difference-in-difference comparison between control and exposure groups. This involved removing correlation through regressing out the first principal component (likely capturing smoking status and age), and addressing the multiple testing problem through controling the False Discovery Rate.
