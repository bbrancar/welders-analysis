**Welding Fumes and Gene Expression

Exposure to ambient particulate air pollution is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Godleski et al. 2000). The welding process creates high levels of metal fume containing respirable particles, associated with inflammatory lung disease such asthma, and cardiovascular events. This project assesses systemic alterations (e.g. changes in gene expression) from air pollution, caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines subsequent to pulmonary inflammation (precursors of atherosclerosis and coronary diseases).
